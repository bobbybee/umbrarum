ideas for clues
=================

_Note:  Clues will alternate between complicated IRL puzzles / experiences, and traditional, poem F8C7A6-style clues_

## IRL

* QR codes
* Linear Barcodes
* Haiku's
* Poem (e.g. sonnets)
* Printed paper in printer, possibly seen being printed to make it look more magic (so it wouldn't look like somebody put the paper there, more magical)
  * This could be accomplished by one of us preloading the printer with our clue ahead of time, and simply printing a blank piece of paper when it is needed. However, the issue is that people are printing nonstop, and we don't know when it would be printed. Perhaps we could alert the teachers ahead of time, and print to the "Wheeler Room" printer, or perhaps the MS lounge printer could go down for "scheduled maintenance".

* Use Arduino?
* Use Makey Makey?
  * with LOCKERS because they're METAL?
  * with PAPER with GRAPHITE?
* CAPACATIVE SENSING with LOCKERS! (sense when locker is touched and make magic happen)

* iBeacon
* AirPlay (audio or video/image?)
* AirDrop (an image?)

* Electronic candle/torch (paper, fan, and high-intensity LED)
  * Perhaps we have 9 of them in a box (3x3 matrix formation), and we do one of those puzzles where you illuminating one would extinguish all of the touching lights, and you are trying to get all of them on.
  * Or maybe we have a torch in a transparent case, and in order to get the clue, you have to extinguish the torch (infrared blaster? bluetooth?)
  
* ~~Stubborn clue. (clue "paper" would be an Internet-facing LCD; you have to go to the website to reason with it / force it to talk).~~
  * ~~Relatively easy to do and we could really play with the personality and make the clue have a life of its own.~~

* Sudoku using 7-segment LEDs. The solution to the puzzle as a whole would be the key to unlock the next clue. 
  * Not very magical, though. Thoughts?

* Levitation
  * Google it. It's possible

## not IRL

* imgur's
* anonymous reddit posts
* http server on given ip

* Internet Radio Technology
 * Stream audio at a certain time
 
* Audio Manipulation and Duplication
 * recordings backwards as clues
 * recordings inserted at a certain timestamp in a popular song
