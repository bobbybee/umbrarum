formats for clues
=================

_Note:  All clues should start IRL, but they can go into the internet._

## IRL

* QR codes
* Linear Barcodes
* Haiku's
* Poem (e.g. sonnets)
* Printed paper in paper

* Use Arduino?
* Use Makey Makey?
  * with LOCKERS because they're METAL?
  * with PAPER with GRAPHITE?
* CAPACATIVE SENSING with LOCKERS! (sense when locker is touched and make magic happen)

* iBeacon
* AirPlay (audio or video/image?)
* AirDrop (an image?)

* Electronic candle/torch (paper, fan, and high-intensity LED)
  * Perhaps we have 3 of them in a box, and we do one of those puzzles where you illuminating one would extinguish another, and you are trying to get all of them on.
  * Or maybe we have a torch in a transparent case, and in order to get the clue, you have to extinguish the torch (infrared blaster? bluetooth?)

## not IRL

* imgur's
* anonymous reddit posts
* http server on given ip
