formats for clues
=================

_Note:  All clues should start IRL, but they can go into the internet._

## IRL

* QR codes
* Linear Barcodes
* Haiku's
* Poem (e.g. sonnets)
* Printed paper in printer, possibly seen being printed to make it look more magic (so it wouldn't look like somebody put the paper there, more magical)

* Use Arduino?
* Use Makey Makey?
  * with LOCKERS because they're METAL?
  * with PAPER with GRAPHITE?
* CAPACATIVE SENSING with LOCKERS! (sense when locker is touched and make magic happen)

* iBeacon
* AirPlay (audio or video/image?)
* AirDrop (an image?)

* Electronic candle/torch (paper, fan, and high-intensity LED)
  * Perhaps we have 9 of them in a box (3x3 matrix formation), and we do one of those puzzles where you illuminating one would extinguish all of the touching lights, and you are trying to get all of them on.
  * Or maybe we have a torch in a transparent case, and in order to get the clue, you have to extinguish the torch (infrared blaster? bluetooth?)
  
* Stubborn clue. (clue "paper" would be an Internet-facing LCD; you have to go to the website to reason with it / force it to talk).
  * Relatively easy to do and we could really play with the personality and make the clue have a life of its own. 

## not IRL

* imgur's
* anonymous reddit posts
* http server on given ip
