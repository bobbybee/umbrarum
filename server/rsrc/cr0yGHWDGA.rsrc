<h1>venēficī umbrārum sumus</h1>

We are VENĒFICĪ UMBRĀRUM. Our leaders are Alyssa and Jacob. If you are reading this message, you are beginning your path to become a līberātor. This clue is the first in a long journey to liberate our school; today, there is powerful magic trapped in our school. From this point forward, you must collaborate with the other līberātōrēs to re-learn the magic that flourished between our walls. The venēficī umbrārum, through cryptic clues, will teach limitless amounts of magic. There is only one condition: you must listen. 

Alyssa is currently in another universe buying pixie dust. She will be back soon, but she is rather secretive and refuses to tell the other venēficī umbrārum exactly when she will return. In the meantime, go the http://umbrarum.com/ and teleport through the registration portal. You will be notified when the first obstacle is placed (and subsequently, the first spell is learned).
