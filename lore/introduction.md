Venēficī umbrārum sumus.
=======

We are VENĒFICĪ UMBRĀRUM. Our leaders are Alyssa and Jacob. You need not know the identities of any other members of our organization. If you are reading this message, you are officially a līberātor. This clue is the first in a long journey to liberate our school; today, a great wizard lays trapped in an unknown classroom. From this point forward, you must collaborate with the other līberātōrēs to re-learn the magic once held in our school. The venēficī umbrārum, through cryptic clues, will teach limitless amounts of magic. There is one condition: you must listen.
