project outline (chronological order)
===============================

1. impress *Liberators* with cool magic (real technology)
  * _see [ideas](https://github.com/bobbybee/umbrarum/blob/master/ideas/clues-ideas.md)_
    1. **locker trick** (capactive sensing, maybe in another/a different format?)
    2. maybe a **QR code**? (is it magic enough? could be magical if it is found in a magical way, e.g. projected on teacher's projecter via AirPlay)
    3. **Makey Makey** with graphite on a paper, all circuits and wires as hidden as possible (circuit board can't be blatantly obvious)
    4. **Physical Puzzles**; see "candle puzzle" in [ideas](https://github.com/bobbybee/umbrarum/blob/master/ideas/clues-ideas.md)
    4. _Note: if something boring like a poem were to be included in a clue or as a clue, it should be based on something magical like a hidden LCD screen turned on/actived by a timer or some other "magical" element_
  * have an **AMAZING** website--it has to look really good, function really well, and make sense (this will make us look like we are wizards in many fields)
  * **use lots of sensors!**
   * accelerometers, location sensors, etc.
2. lead the _Liberators_ to believe that they can make their own magic
  * have a virtual "cmd prompt" in website to cast "spells" that cause physical things to happen almost instantaneously ("cmd prompt" => **"magic wand"** or something)
   * e.g. connect motor interfaces or actuators to a server, virtual cmd prompt on website sends signals over a websocket to that server to control interfaces (i.e motors, etc.)
3. lead the _Liberators_ to a place where they supposedly cause something magical to happen at their will
4. One of us turns on the other, starting up a large conspiracy about whether there is magic in the school or whether it was made up to make the turned-on more popular. Liberators are torn in half.
5. Teach the Liberators our tricks.
6. Finale is a competition where Liberators need to use our infrastructure to create new magic, on there own.
7. The winner becomes a V.B.
