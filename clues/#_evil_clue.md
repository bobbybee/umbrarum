Clue #: evil_clue
====================

A small LCD display somehow mounted on the wall, initialized with the words, 
> I have the clue. \ You don't. Haha.

When any person goes to the official website, _umbrarum.com_, a piezo buzzer on the device makes a high-pitched noise and the LCD prints the following words, letter by letter (like a typewriter):
> Can't enchant me \ Don't waste time

Finally, when a person goes to the **Magic wand** page on the website, the taunting continues:
> Authorization... \ DENIED! Go away.

When the correct spell, `pande` is typed and enter is hit ("executes the spell"), the clue responds as follows:
> OK, master :)
(pause)
> Venefici, summon
(pause)
> --Clue sent

The clue will pop up on the web browser of the liberator.
